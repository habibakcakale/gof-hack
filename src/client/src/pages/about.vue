            Defining tasks is an important step to convert a prototype into the
            live, working product. In order to do so, all the steps needed to
            design and develop this product is divided and grouped into the
            minimal tasks which helps to create a collaborative workspace. This
            mission is generally assigned to the people with Project Manager,
            Business Analyst or Solution Architect roles.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the challenges these people come across are estimating the
            time and cost of the project before design & development. For making
            proper estimations, people with technical backgrounds and project
            management experiences needed to come up with common decision, which
            means it needs teamwork and other peoples' work hours. This also
            comes with another problem, since people might not share a common
            decision, they have to spend much more time and effort to persuade
            each other.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to achieve this mission much faster and simpler, while PM
            is creating tasks and their estimations, it can be assisted with
            similar previous real-time estimations and results. What we are
            aiming with <strong>JAPE (Just Another Project Estimator)</strong>
            is showing this similar experiences from before and make suggestions
            with all this data combined. Since it uses real-life data,
            estimations would be much more realistic.

          <p>
            <strong>JAPE</strong> is an Issue Time Estimation Assistant which
            helps Project Managers to estimate the time needed for tasks by
            referencing from previous experiences. JAPE has been developed in
            the hackathon challenge, OSF Hackers 2019 by the team Gang of Four.
